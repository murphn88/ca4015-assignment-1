# Conclusion

The first part of this project consisted of exploratory data analysis. We validated the datasets were as described which gave us confidence to continue using the data for the remainder of the project. 

We clustered on the prinicipal components of the data, and visualize the resulting clusters in a 3 dimensional plot.

## Future Work

K-means clustering analysis of the combined IGT datasets from multiple different sudies, indicates that the IGT can be done in a controlled, unbiased manner. The environment the subjects performed the IGT did not appear to affect their performance, or their approach to the task, This is a positive result and it means that these datasets can be combined and used as a control group. All participants in these studies were deemed cognitively healty, so this dataset could be used in conjunction with a dataset for 'unhealthy' subjects, to look for differences in how they perform and approach the task.  

Further work could be done on the K-means privacy preservation between labs. Privacy of data has always been a key consideration of medical or psychological data, but it increasing of growing concern for most, if not all, industries. The work I've completed on privacy preservation was very simplistic, and a lot more could be done to improve the cluster procuced in this private manner.
